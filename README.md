Growing a DSL in Ruby Guided by Tests
=====================================

This is the accompanying code for my talk at the Ruby Underground Meetup on October 18th, in Tel Aviv.
The event has been recorded, but unfortunately the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li2WmhMGWBI) stops in the middle of my presentation.

This talk has been inspired by Gary Bernhardt's DAS screencast #03. [Check](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/building-rspec-from-scratch) it out.
